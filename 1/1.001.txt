Q: Extend the notion of regularity to input/output objects of a procedure, that
is, to objects that are modified as well as read.

A: In a regular procedure, equal input/output objects will be transformed in
the same way; that is, if two equal objects are used as input/output objects
for a regular proecdure, the objects will remain equal after the procedure is
invoked.
