Q: Assuming that int is a 32-bit two's complement type, determine the exact
definition and result space.

[ This question refers to the square function with parameter of type int and
return value of type int. ]

A: The defintion space is [-46340, 46340]. The result space is { x * x | x in Z, -46340 <= x <= 46340 }.

Explanation: the range of int for a 32-bit two's complement is
[-2147483648, 2147483647]. The largest integer in this range whose square is also
within this range is 46340.
